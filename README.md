# Chip-8-Emulator

It is easy to expand upon. You could put your interpreter on the web, and let the user upload their own roms and play them in the browser. You could create a server for pong where two players can play pong against each other on your emulator. You can create users and keep track of their playing history and W/L records. It is often said one good portfolio project is better than several half-baked ones, and this gives you away to iteratively make this project gradually more and more impressive.
